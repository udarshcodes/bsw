Features

Real-time Visualization: Manipulate the qubit state in 3D using sliders for the theta ($\theta$) and phi ($\phi$) angles.

Numeric Input: Set a precise value for the phi ($\phi$) angle using a text box.

Quantum Gate Simulation: Instantly apply common quantum gates (X, Y, Z, H, S, T) to the current state and see the result.

State Presets: Jump directly to common states like $|0\rangle$, $|+\rangle$, and $|-\rangle$.

AI-Powered Explanations: Click the "Explain with AI" button to get a detailed theoretical breakdown of the current state, generated by the Gemini API.

Live Readouts: Instantly see the state vector $|\psi\rangle$ and the measurement probabilities for $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$.
