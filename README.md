⚛️ **Interactive Bloch Sphere Visualizer**

This is a web-based educational tool that provides a fully interactive 3D Bloch Sphere visualization. It is designed for students, teachers, and enthusiasts who want to explore and understand fundamental concepts of quantum computing and qubit states.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-Time Visualization:** Manipulate the qubit state in 3D using sliders for the theta (`θ`) and phi (`φ`) angles.
- **Numeric Input:** Enter a precise value for the phi (`φ`) angle using a text box.
- **Quantum Gate Simulation:** Instantly apply common quantum gates (`X`, `Y`, `Z`, `H`, `S`, `T`) to the current state and observe the result.
- **State Presets:** Jump directly to standard states such as `|0⟩`, `|+⟩`, and `|-⟩`.
- **AI-Powered Explanations:** Click the **"Explain with AI"** button to generate a detailed theoretical breakdown of the current state using the Google Gemini API.
- **Live Readouts:** View the state vector `|ψ⟩` and the measurement probabilities for `|0⟩` and `|1⟩` in real time.
- **Measurement Insights:** Instantly see the probabilities of measuring `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`.
